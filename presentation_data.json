They\nvisit  hosts  door  to  door and  take high\u2011quality  photos  of  their properties,  discovering  that  they\nincrease  conversion from  listings  to  rentals  by  2.5X.  By  month\u2019s end, NYC  revenues  double.\nChesky explains:\n    Do things that don\u2019t scale. We start with the perfect experience and then work backward. That\u2019s\n    how we\u2019re going to continue to be successful.\u00b9\u2075\nGebbia adds:\n    And I\u2019d show the photos in the back of the camera\u2026 and these hosts were like \u201cOh my god, my\n    apartment looks amazing, I can\u2019t believe it, do you want to stay for some tea or coffee?\u201d And so,\n    I\u2019d end up spending a few hours sometimes in their homes just talking with them. And this is where\n    instinctively we went into design research mode, which is going out and talking to the people you\u2019re\n    designing for [so] you can understand the world from their point of view to inform your point of\n    view. I call this \u201cenlightened empathy,\u201d which is seeing the world so closely in the shoes of the\n    person that you are creating for, that you can see the world the way they see it. Now you bring these\n    insights back and combine them with your own design point of view to create something new.16\nAnd the things that \u201cdon\u2019t scale\u201d early on, scale up later:\n     \u2026 Rinse and repeat. When we fixed the product in New York, it [later] solved our problems in\n    Paris, London, Vancouver, and Miami.\u00b9\u2077\nApril 2009 \u2013 Airbnb raises a seed round of $600,000 led by Sequoia Capital. Sequoia had been\nstudying  the  vacation  rental  market  and  was  looking  to  invest  in  this  area.  According  to\nSequoia\u2019s Alfred Lin, Airbnb was\n    one of the rare global network effects companies in commerce, and that was something that we got\n    our minds around as a proprietary defensible advantage. And one of the things that we look for in\n    a company that we invest in is some form of proprietary advantage that allows you to win. That\n    could be a technology advantages, that could be network effects, that could be a disruptive business\n    model, and [Airbnb] had both a disruptive business model and network effects. And it brings the\n    technology to bear on a service like bed and breakfast which lots more people than you might think\n    would use.\u00b9\u2078\nReid Hoffman\u2019s\u00b9\u2079 first investment as a venture capitalist was in Airbnb, but he failed to invest in\nthis round. Hoffman explains how he was first pitched on Airbnb:\n    \u201cOh, I got this really exciting investment and I think it\u2019s really, really, really interesting and I\u2019m\n    looking to make an investment in it myself. It\u2019s Airbnb.\u201d And I go like, what\u2019s that? \u201cWell, it\u2019s\n    renting couches, you know, everyone has couches and now every space opens up because you can"
