Case Write Up: L’Oréal China
Brief Assessment:
Yue Sai, once a prestigious Chinese cosmetics brand founded by Yue-Sai Kan, had strong national roots but lost momentum and relevance by the time L’Oréal acquired it in 2004.
Multiple failed repositionings led to brand confusion; its customer base is now mostly older women, with low awareness among younger consumers.
L’Oréal faces the challenge of reviving a faded local brand in a competitive market shaped by rising local players, national pride, and digital consumption.
Younger Chinese consumers are wealthier, career-focused, digitally engaged, brand aware and favor skin care—especially when rooted in tradition—over cosmetics.
Competitor domestic brands like Herborist thrive by blending traditional Chinese medicine with modern, culturally resonant branding.
TV ads are expensive and less effective; digital platforms like Weibo and Youku, paired with experiential retail, offer better engagement.
L’Oréal’s city-tier strategy must align with clearer brand identity and adapt to evolving consumer expectations.
Successful positioning will require a narrative that connects modern aspirations with cultural heritage, especially for today’s working yet family-oriented women.

Recommendation: Alternative 1 -  Yue Sai for Modern Young Women
We recommend Alternative 1 as it offers a clear and focused strategy to rebuild Yue Sai’s brand and achieve both luxury appeal and cultural relevance through TCM, thus helping it stand out from its competition. It connects strongly with modern, health-conscious young women - China’s most influential skincare consumers. It also allows Yue Sai to tap into a growing segment of digitally-engaged, and culturally proud customers who value skincare rooted in TCM.
This alternative provides Yue Sai a unique position in L’Oreal’s portfolio. It is distinct from the L’Oreal brand and from other L’Oreal luxury brands such as Lancome, due to its price point and cultural relevance to the Chinese market respectively. This focused repositioning offers the best path to regain relevance and long-term sustainable growth.
